			<p class="hideme">Little  is known about Absol early in the story.  What is made clear however, is that he is known as a kind, loyal general.  He is also known to be wise and helpful as he is always seen and shown helping adventurers.  He also shows traits of being "fatherly", "Hey, stop running!  Oh, whatever!"  Speculations are that he was actually a good man and his behavior was not an act but the event at ____ changed him so that it forever marked him and consumed him.  Is the true antagonist behind the opening of the Portal.  While it seemed that Sehven was the evil, it was Absol, who everyone thought was one of the best guys.  He had given and helped everytime but it was so that Sehven would come out and he would be able to kill him for the final piece.  Is intervened by Rider before he can deliver the finishing blow.<br>
				Is seen last spewing blood back against the wall.

			<p class="hideme2">Believes that we are bounded by this world and by gathering the pieces of 9, he will be able to travel into a new world.  He wishes to wash away all memory because it is the memories of the past that is keeping us from moving forward and being guided in one purpose so that there is no disagreement and move toward one goal.  In other words, subserviance.  He believes that it is human weakness that we wish to live a happy life and not move into the future faster when offerred the chance.  The thought is fine but the way he goes about it by killing millions to achieve it is not.<br>
				While it is noted that his agenda seems to be directed from the Dark One, it should be  made clear that Absol follows his own agenda.  His like-mindedness with the Dark One of destroying as much of the world as possible is in his mind, is to cause enough erasion that following is the only choice.  
				He is often thought as the most appalling of characters because of his relationship to many protagonists and how he easily throws away those relationships and even goes further to destroy those close to that person.  The transition is also very sudden and so contrast without a moment explaining.
